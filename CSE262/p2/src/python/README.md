# CSE 262: Programming Assignment 2: Scanning Slang in Python

In this folder, you should implement a scanner for slang in Python.  You
should be sure to use the documents in the `../../specifications` folder to
guide your work.

You can run the code in interactive mode by typing `python3 slang.py -scan`.
To scan a file directly, provide a file name, e.g., by typing `python3
slang.py -scan ../tests/scan/fail_char_1.scm`.
