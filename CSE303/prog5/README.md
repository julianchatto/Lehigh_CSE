# Assignment #5: A Virtual Execution Environment

In this assignment, we will gain a deeper appreciation for the power of
virtualization.  We will do so in two ways.  First, we will transform our
key/value store into a server that provides a new feature: map/reduce
functionality.  Second, we will heavily use the process abstraction to keep
our server secure while we provide this new feature.

You will need to think about virtualization, concurrency, security, and 
resource management.

## Do This First

Immediately after pulling `p5` from Github, rename the folder solutions_sunlab 
to solutions if you are using sunlab machines, or rename the folder 
solutions_docker to solutions if you are using docker. Navigate to the `p5` folder, 
and type `chmod +x solutions/*.exe`.  This command only needs to be run once.  
It will make sure that certain files from the assignment have their executable bit set.

## Assignment Details

In Java, it is possible to use *dynamic class loading* to load `.class` files
into a running program.  If the loaded class implements an `interface` that
the program already understands, it can use the new class anywhere that the
old interface was used.

In C++, we can do something very similar: we can compile a `.cc` file to a
*shared object* (`.so`), and then load it into our program.  When we load it,
we can pick out functions within the shared object and use them.  Shared
objects (or "DLLs", in Windows) are incredibly powerful for a number of
reasons that you should understand.  The use of shared objects in this
assignment is not the most common, but it is critical to many on-line
services.

To leverage this feature, we will add an *administrator* concept to our
server.  The administrator's user name will be given on the command line.
The administrator will have a new command that only it can execute from the
client: `KVF`, which registers functions.  Note that you will still need to
*register* an administrator account... it will not be created automatically,
despite the command-line argument.

To use KVF, the administrator needs a `.so` with two functions: `map()` and
`reduce()`.  Any user can use a `KMR` command to request that these functions
be used.  Note that these functions must not have "mangled" names.  The
source code uses `extern "C" {}` for this purpose.

To use the functions, the server will do something similar to a `KVA`: it
will iterate through all the key/value pairs, obeying 2pl.  For each pair, it
will call the `map()` function, and append the result to a temporary
`vector`.  Once all the pairs have been visited, then the server will pass
the temporary vector to the `reduce()` function.  The final result will be
sent back to the user.

Your server will need to maintain a `std::unordered_map` to hold the
registered functions. It should use a `std::shared_mutex` (a readers/writer
lock), so that multiple threads can get functions from the map
simultaneously, but only one thread can insert new functions.

We have one final requirement: running user-provided code inside the server
process is dangerous.  We don't want to simply trust the administrator to
only load safe code.  Instead, the server should `fork()` a child process and
use `pipe()` to create channels for communicating with the child.  The parent
will iterate through keys, and will send them to the child.  The child will
execute the `map()` and `reduce()` functions.  The child will then write the
result back on a pipe, so that a server thread can send the result to the
client.

In and of itself, running the code in a separate process may not seem like it
adds much security.  However, because of the way that `fork()` works, the
server can "sandbox" the executable code.  In particular, we will use the
`seccomp` feature of modern Linux to disable the creation of new files in the
child process.  This means that the child cannot open back-doors or snoop the
file system.

## Getting Started

Your git repository has a new folder, `p5`, which contains a complete
solution to p4, as compiled `.o` files.  The `Makefile` has been updated so
that you do not need to have completed the first four assignments in order to
get full credit for this assignment.

There is a test script called `scripts/p5.py`, which you can use to test your
code.  Reading these tests will help you to understand the expected behavior
of the server.

The new commands and API extensions appear below.  The relevant constants
have been added to `common/constants.h`.

```C++

const std::string REQ_KVF = "KVF_";
```

## Tips and Reminders

When you call `fork()` from a multithreaded process, the new child process
will only have one thread: a clone of the thread who called `fork()`.  There
are no guarantees about the state of any locks in the child process.
Therefore, it is essential that you do not have the child access the
key/value store: it could wait forever.

If you `dlclose()` a .`so`, its functions are no longer available.  You will
need to keep open any `.so` that you have loaded, and only close them at
shutdown time.

When calling `dlopen()`, you cannot re-use file names, even after deleting
the files.  You also cannot load a `.so` from a `std::vector`... you must use
a temporary file.  You should think carefully about how to make unique file
names to pass to `dlopen()`.

You do not need to enforce quotas on the `KMR` and `KVF` functions.

**Start Early**.  Just reading the code and understanding what is happening
takes time.  If you start reading the assignment early, you'll give yourself
time to think about what is supposed to be happening, and that will help you
to figure out what you will need to do.

As always, please be careful about not committing unnecessary files into your
repository.

Your server should **not** store plain-text passwords in the file.

## Grading

The `scripts` folder has two scripts that exercise the main portions of the
assignment: `KVF`, basic `KMR`, and process-based isolation.  These scripts
use specialized `Makefiles` that integrate some of the solution code with
some of your code, so that you can get partial credit when certain portions
of your code work.  Note that these `Makefiles` are very strict: they will
crash on any compiler warning.  You should *not* turn off the warnings; they
are there to help you. If your code does not compile with the scripts, I
reserve the right to give zero credit for the assignment.

If the scripts pass, then you will receive full "functionality" points.  I
will manually inspect your code to determine if it is correct with regard to
atomicity, and to ensure that it is cleaning up after itself correctly.  As
before, I reserve the right to deduct "style" points if your code is
especially convoluted.  Please be sure to use your tools well.  For example,
Visual Studio Code (and emacs, and vim) have features that auto-format your
code.  You should use these features.

Please do not move functions between files, or add files, or do other things
that break the scripts in the grading folder.

There are five main graded portions of the assignment:

* Do .so files load correctly and securely on the server?
* Can clients invoke functions on the server?
* Are map() and reduce() running in a child process?
* Is the child process using seccomp features?
* Is the program correct with regard to concurrency?

## Notes About the Reference Solution

You will need to implement `my_functable.cc`.  Note that every valid `.so`
will have a function called `map()` and a function called `reduce()`.  Also,
note that the `.cc` files that produce the .so files must avoid C++ name
mangling, through the use of `extern "C" {}`.  While you do not need to write
any new shared objects, it is good to understand the code that is provided.

The design of the `func_table` object is specified for you.  You will
 need a strategy for having unique names.  
 The reference solution is 118 lines of code.

The rest of the functionality for this assignment is in the `my_mapreduce.cc`
file.  This file is not part of the `Storage` object, so the `Storage` object
will pass it everything it needs.  This is not an especially good way to
write code, but I didn't want you to have to re-implement `my_storage.cc`.

The implementation of `register_mr()` in `server/my_mapreduce.cc` does not do
much more than call the `functable`'s `register_mr()`.
`functable::register_mr()` requires about 40 lines of code to implement.

The implementation of `invoke_mr` is much more complex, because it needs to
`fork()` and `waitpid()`, manage `pipe()` objects, interact with `seccomp`,
run a `do_all_readonly()`, and interact with a child process by reading and
writing via pipes.  The reference solution is about 130 lines of code,
including all of the error handling.  This code also makes use of a helper
function, `child_mr`, which is run by the child process.  The helper is the code that
actually runs the functions on the data that is extracted from the k/v store.
It is about 45 lines.

## Collaboration and Getting Help

You may work in teams of 2 for this assignment.
If you are working in a team, you should **pair program** for the entire assignment.
After all, your goal is to learn together, not to each learn half the
material.

If you require help, you may seek it from any of the following sources:

* The professor and TAs, via office hours or Piazza
* The Internet, as long as you use the Internet as a read-only resource and
  do not post requests for help to online sites.

It is not appropriate to share code with past or current CSE 303 students,
unless you are sharing code with your teammate.

If you are familiar with `man` pages, please note that the easiest way to
find a man page is via Google.  For example, typing `man printf` will
probably return `https://linux.die.net/man/3/printf` as one of the first
links.  It is fine to use Google to find man pages.

StackOverflow is a wonderful tool for professional software engineers.  It is
a horrible place to ask for help as a student.  You should feel free to use
StackOverflow, but only as a *read only* resource.  In this class, you should
**never** need to ask a question on StackOverflow.

In addition, you should not use generative AI when trying to complete this
assignment.  It will not help you to learn, and that should be your goal.

## Deadline

You should be done with this assignment before 11:59 PM on December 16th, 2024.
Please be sure to `git commit` and `git push` before that time, so that I can
promptly collect and grade your work.
